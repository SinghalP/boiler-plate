## Karma-ES6-Boilerplate
It is designed to make life easy by providing a basic framework with which to kickstart JS project. It contains a best-practice directory structure to ensure code reusability and maximum scalability.

## Philosophy

* The build system should work automagically, without involvement from the developer. It should do what needs to be done, while staying out of the way. Components should end up tested, linted, compiled, and minified, ready for use in a production environment.
* Integration with popular tools like Gulp,SASS,Webpack.
* Encourages test-driven development. It's the only way to code.
* A directory structure that is cogent, meaningful to new team members, and supporting of the above points.
